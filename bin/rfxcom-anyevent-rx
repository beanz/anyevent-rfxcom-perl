# ABSTRACT: example script to read from an RFXCOM receiver
# PODNAME: rfxcom-anyevent-rx

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # read from USB tty device
  rfxcom-anyevent-rx /dev/ttyUSB0

  # read from USB device with nicer name see Device::RFXCOM::RX(3)
  rfxcom-anyevent-rx /dev/rfxcom-rx

  # read from network/wireless device
  rfxcom-anyevent-rx 10.0.0.1:10001

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is an example of the usage of the L<AnyEvent::RFXCOM::RX>
api.  It simply initializes the receiver and writes a summary of the
received RF messages to stdout.  The keys and values given on the
command line become the parameter hash for the
L<AnyEvent::RFXCOM::RX#new> constructor and are documented in that
module.
